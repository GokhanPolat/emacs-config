(require 'saveplace)

(defun al/save-places-to-alist ()
  "Go through `buffer-list', saving places to alist.
This function is intended to be used as a substitution for
`save-places-to-alist'.  The difference is: this function does
not save positions for `dired' buffers."
  (dolist (buffer (buffer-list))
    (with-current-buffer buffer
      (when buffer-file-name
        (save-place-to-alist)))))
